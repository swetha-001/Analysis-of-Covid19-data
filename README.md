* In this project I have analyzed the Covid-19 dataset by writing SQL queries to answer questions about deaths, vaccinations and Infection Rate due to covid pandemic across different countries.
* The dataset contains information about the total cases, deaths, vaccinations and more across several countries in a continent during the pandemic. This analysis can used to find the answers to questions like :

1. What percentage of people vaccinated relative to the total population ?

2. What are the average number of new cases per day in a country ?

3. What percentage of people died compared to population with in each country ?

4. Which country has the highest number of cases in a continent ?

* The data used in this project is provided by Our world in data
